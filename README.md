## RichBlocksPoorBlocks.com Development ##

This branch contains the non-minified versions of the files found on the RichBlocksPoorBlocks ['master'](https://github.com/myprogprojects/RichBlocksPoorBlocks) branch.

If you think you can make [RichBlocksPoorBlocks.com](http://www.RichBlocksPoorBlocks.com) even better than it currently is, then prove it. And if your idea rocks, you'll get credit on the homepage, as well as a link back to your site (or blog, or social media page, or whatever else).

If you do fork this branch, it would be mighty nice of you to name your repo 'RichBlocksPoorBlocks_{YOUR_IDEA_HERE}'. That way, it'll be easier for everyone to keep track of what everyone else is doing.

Got a question? Email RichBlocksPoorBlocks@gmail.com, Tweet [@RichBlocksPoorB](https://twitter.com/RichBlocksPoorB).

Thanks much, and happy forking, everyone!
